# Arduino Game System

This is the code behind https://imgur.com/gallery/kc4k2pO . It's a simple handheld game system powered by an Arduino Pro Mini and it uses an 8x8 RGB LED grid as its screen. It has two buttons for input (left and right) and is powered by two AAA batteries.

## Heads Up: This code is pretty awful. 

Feel free to change it up or submit fixes.

The breakout code is modeled after https://github.com/MakerTechDK/8x8LEDMatrixBreakoutGame . MakerTechDK's plays much, _much_ better though...
